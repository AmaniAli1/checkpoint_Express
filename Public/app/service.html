            <h1>Middleware Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next function is a function in the Express router that, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
                Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
                
                   
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Execute any code.
                Make changes to the request and the response objects.
                End the request-response cycle.
                Call the next middleware in the stack.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

            <h1>Routes Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Routes are one of the core concepts in Express and one of the things that make it really useful.
                Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request, at a particular endpoint, which is called a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).
            </p>
            <p>Each route can have one or more handler functions which are executed when the route is matched.
                Route definition takes the following structure:</p>
                <p>app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)</p>
            <p>
                app is an instance of express.
                METHOD is an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
                PATH is a path on the server.
                HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.

            <h1>Using template engines with Express</h1>
            <p>
                Template engine allows you to use static template files in your application. To render template files you have to set the following application setting properties:
            </p>
            <p>
                Views: It specifies a directory where the template files are located.
                For example: app.set('views', './views').
                view engine: It specifies the template engine that you use. For example, to use the Pug template engine: app.set('view engine', 'pug')
            </p>
            <p>Pug Template Engine

                Let's learn how to use Pug template engine in Node.js applications using Express.js. Pug is a template engine for Node.js. Pug uses white spaces and indentation as part of its syntax. Its syntax is easy to learn.
